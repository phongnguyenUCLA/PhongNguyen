                science and linguistics. Currently I work at code ninjas where I teach students 
                how to code in various languags such as python and C#. I'm a passionate 
                coder who loves creating web applications and solving complex problems. Welcome to my 
                portfolio, where you can find some of my favorite projects.</p></div>

            <h3>Multiplayer Battleship</h3>
            <p>Developed a two-player Battleship game with real-time network communication using Python sockets. 
                Designed game logic for handling attacks, ship placement, and win conditions with classes for 
                players and the game board. Integrated JSON for data exchange between server and client, 
                enabling synchronization of ship locations and attack results between players. Implemented 
                features for tracking hits, misses, and ships across the board using object-oriented principles 
                and error handling.</p>

        <h3>Tron</h3>
        <p>Developed a two-player remake of the classic Tron game using Python and the CMU Graphics library. 
            Implemented smooth player movement with WASD and arrow key controls, and designed competitive 
            gameplay where players aim to outlast or eliminate their opponent. Created multiple game rounds 
            with increasing difficulty, including dynamic obstacle placement in later stages. Integrated 
            collision detection and scoring systems to track player performance. Designed custom graphics 
            and game elements, enhancing the visual experience through grid-based backgrounds and player trails.
